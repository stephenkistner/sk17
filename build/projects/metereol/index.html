  <h2>How does the weather feel?</h2>
  <p class="emph">Metereol is a weather visualizer. It generates a holistic representation of how it feels outside.</p>
    <div class="role">
      <h6>My Role:</h6>
      <small>I concepted, designed & built Metereol in just 3 weeks. I constructed a visual system that represents weather data, worked around the limitations of P5.js to build a functional prototype, and published the app on the Chrome web store.</small>

        <small> Setbacks are inevitable. Determining which problems to solve and which to work around is essential to developing a solid product.</small>

<h5>The Challenge</h5>
<h3>Temperature is a feeling, not a number.</h3>
<p>Imagine a hot summer day in the city. A thick soup of stagnant air surrounds your body as you step outside. How does it feel? <b>Pretty freaking uncomfortable.</b></p>
<p>We measure weather with a series of numbers and percentages, but we experience it much like the above situation. Above all else, we feel them.</p>

<p class="emph">I wanted to evoke these sensations through dynamic visual compositions.</p>

<p>How it feels outside also depends on more than just temperature. A summer day with a breeze feels drastically different than one with no breeze and high humidity. To accurately describe how it felt, I needed to take all of these factors into account.</p>

<h5>The Approach</h5>
<h3>Complex Feelings, Simple Language</h3>
<p>How we sense the weather is a complex, multi-sensory event. The feel of hot air against the skin. The sight of storm clouds looming on the horizon. How can such abstract ideas be communicated visually?</p>

<p class="emph">The system needed to be relatable. It needed structure.</p>

<p>I wanted to make something that operated as both a functional tool and a visual experience. To be useful, the system needed structure. It needed a language. By using each data point like a word in a sentence, I could convey complex weather conditions through just a few components.</p>

<div class="inline-video">
<div class='embed-container' style="padding-bottom: 33.49%"> <!--DEFAULT 56.25 -->
  <iframe class="hidecontrols"  src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/202122111?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&autoplay=1&loop=1' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>
</div>

  <p>I settled on four key data points: <b>temperature</b>, <b>humidity</b>, <b>precipitation</b> and <b>cloud cover</b>. Together, these metrics reflected most weather conditions without adding unnecessary complexity to the system. I later added time of day to make the compositions more dynamic.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>The Process</h5>
<h3>Equal parts big and small</h3>
<p>Each metric needed its own symbolic representation. But, like a sentence, the entire composition needed to convey more meaning than just its parts.</p>

<p class="emph">Thinking about how each part related to the whole was essential.</p>

<p>I structured my workflow around this principle. From sketching to prototyping, each element needed to be viewed in the context of the system. Often, a color or shape would take on an entirely different meaning when viewed with the rest of the components.</p>

<div class="img-caption-R">
  <img src="/projects/metereol/sketches2.jpg" alt="Sketches2" />
  <p class="caption"><b>Rough, gestural sketches</b> helped express how different atmospheric conditions felt. From these, I developed more refined drawings to flesh out the visual style.</p>
</div>


<img src="/projects/metereol/illy.jpg" alt="Illy" />
<p class=""><span class="lead">Working digitally right away</span> let me explore the relationships between different colors and forms. I could rapidly combine elements and look at the system as a whole as I developed its parts. Working with vectors also enabled me to think about how each part would translate into code.</p>

<div class="img-caption-R">
  <img src="/projects/metereol/type.png" alt="Type" />
  <p class="caption"><b>The Typography</b><br>
I chose Calibre Black as the systemâ€™s typeface. Its simple geometric forms put the focus on the visuals. The letterform's small counters and high legibility allowed them to act as containers for the visuals without sacrificing readability.</p>
</div>

<section>
<img src="/projects/metereol/processing.jpg" alt="Processing" />
<p><span class="lead">Using Processing</span>, I started outlining the system's motion. Ultimately the project would live online, but I was most familiar with Processing, and it let me prototype quickly.</p>

  <h3>A Setback</h3>
  <p class="emph">Everything fell apart when I masked the temperature wave inside the type. </p>

  <p>On its own, the temperature wave moved as intended. But when I combined it with the typography, the app would lock up and crash. Using the console, I discovered that the frame rate would plummet as soon as the program launched.</p>
  <p>I knew it was a problem with how the text and wave were combined. Documentation of P5 was sparse online, especially regarding image masks. After hours of digging, I found a solution, and had to change how I layered the visuals.</p>


  <p>The issue occurred when image masks were redrawn each frame. Old masks were not purged from the system's memory. To get around this, I changed how the mask was applied. Rather than clipping the wave inside the text each frame, I had to reverse the mask.</p>
