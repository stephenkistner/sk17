<h5>The Challenge</h5>
<h3>What does &ldquo;business growth&rdquo; mean?</h3>
<p>The ad campaign was part of a larger initiative developed by the Carbone Smolan Agency for BCG called Onwards & Upwards. Leveraging content from their TED@BCG video series, Onwards & Upwards championed BCG's perspective on fostering growth in a rapidly changing world.</p>

  <p>The project consisted of a microsite featuring original content by BCG and the video ad campaign. <b>CSA brought me on to develop the post-roll video ad that would air on TED.com.</b></p>

<p>Onwards & Upwards had a sister project called Ahead of the Curve, produced a year earlier. Like it's accompanying ad, this one needed to be 1.5 minutes long, and would air after the primary content on TED.com. </p>

<p class="emph label">The video had to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Feel similar to its sister video</li>
  <li>Use the existing design elements</li>
  <li>End on the Onwards & Upwards title lockup</li>
</ol>

<h6>But what is business growth?</h6>
<p>Admittedly, I had never heard of BCG before and, after being briefed, only had a vague understanding of what they did. While our copywriter Brittney worked on the first drafts of the script, I examined some of BCG's videos and written content to better understand the vision of the project.</p>

<h5>The Approach</h5>
<h3>An essential force of nature</h3>
<p>BCG's writings covered a diverse range of topics from pharmaceuticals to the booming tech industry. The one connection they all had was the innate nature of growth.</p>

<h5>The Approach</h5>
<h3>Showing how it feels</h3>
<p>Images and visual inputs have a much closer relationship to the visceral. Seeing an ad for the local pool on a hot summer day automatically incites sensations of ....</p>
